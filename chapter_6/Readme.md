Study Drills:

### 1) Go through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it.
___Add your comments to ex6.rb___

Add comments into ex6.rb file

### 2) Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.
___List these places in Readme.md___

line 9: two other strings are put into string in line 9
line 16 and 17: This two lines of string includes other strings.

### 3) Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.
___Was he lying?___

In line 22 prints out string with logic variable as one string.

#### 4) Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.
___Add this explanation to Readme.md___

```+``` combine two separate strings into one string

### 5) What happens when you change the strings to use ' (single-quote) instead of " (double-quote)? Do they still work? Try to guess why.
___Answer this in the Readme.md___

Changing double quotes to single quotes will not work. Only quotes allows to do string interpolation. Otherwise it puts out a string with no inserted variables.

### Rubocop

Was few complains on missing spaces and preferred quotes which I fixed by adding spaces and changing quotes./
