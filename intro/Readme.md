**The output for ex3.rb**

    I will now count my chickens:

    Hens 30

    Roosters 97

    Now I will count the eggs:

    7

    Is it true that 3+2<5-7?

    false

    what is 3+2? 5

    What is 5-7? -2

    Oh, that's why it's false.

    How about some more.

    Is it greater? true

    is it greater or equal? true

    Is it less or equal? false

    Process finished with exit code 0

### 5. Run ```guard``` to check for offenses:
  
> files inspected, 52 offenses detected

> 11:57:45 - INFO - Guard is now watching at '/Users/viola_lv/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2015/homework/lrthw_exercises'

> [1] guard(main)>

### After fixing offenses the output became:
 
> Inspecting 1 file
.

> 1 file inspected, no offenses detected

> [1] guard(main)>
