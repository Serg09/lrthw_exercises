### Do you like string interpolation or format strings? Why?

I like string interpolation because it is easier to understand. More intuitive. 
Also, I tried to manipulate with format string and it did not work as good as interpolation.
May be because I know string interpolation better I feel more comfortable with it. 
And did not see the benefits of the format string. At least until now.

### Rubocop

Got many offenses on double and single-quoting. Changed many string to single-quoting.

Another offence is space inside the brackets missing. Add a space inside the brackets.

Some lines has additional two spaces with I had to remove.

Line 6 was too long. Had to reformat it.
