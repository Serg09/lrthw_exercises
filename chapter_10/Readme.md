### Study Drills:

1) Memorize all the escape sequences by putting them on flash cards.

Add the escape sequences to your Anki deck

> Added

2) Use ''' (triple-single-quote) instead. Can you see why you might use that instead of """?

Explain the difference between these two in the Readme.md

> In this case double-quotes used because string contain single-quotes.

> Also I did not see a reason to use triple-double-quote as it makes no difference. 

> In this chapter used 'escape sequences' which are make possible to do multiply line with single double-quotes.

3) Combine escape sequences and format strings to create a more complex format.

Add these escape sequences to your ex10.rb file.

> put additional 'escape sequences' into exercise.
